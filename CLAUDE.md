# CLAUDE.md

## Project

Love Note - A collaborative block editor for researchers built with GPUI + redb + Automerge.

## Commands

```bash
cargo build    # Build
cargo run      # Run
cargo test     # Test
```

## Rules

1. **Language**: Respond in Japanese. Code in English.
2. **Git**: One feature per commit. Keep commits small and atomic.
3. **Ask**: If unsure about design or implementation, ask immediately.
4. **Style**: Prefer functional style in Rust (not mandatory, choose what's optimal).
